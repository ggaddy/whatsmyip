# Instructions
- lets make a Rust containerized "whats my IP" service.
- I am going to run this on my home kube cluster and expose it via a secure Cloudflare Tunnel so lets make it very secure and reliable.
- it should echo back the source IP of the user
- it should be a very secure and reliable container
- include some effective unit and integrations tests as needed
